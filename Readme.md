"Numerical Linear Algebra Problems". These questions focus on solving systems of linear equations using various numerical methods, such as:

- Gauss-Jordan Method
- Gauss Elimination Method
- Jacobi Iteration Method
- LU Decomposition Method
- Gauss-Seidel Iteration Method

Emphasizing both theoretical and computational aspects of numerical linear algebra.
